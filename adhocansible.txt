AD HOC: 
ad hoc commands are great for tasks you repeat rarely. For example, if you want to power off all the machines in your lab for Christmas vacation, 
you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook. An ad hoc command looks like this: ansible all -m ping

An Ansible ad hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes. 
ad hoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not reusable.
